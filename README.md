# MeGo Excercise System
This application was built for the students and staff of the MeGo program for software engineering.

The system provides an interface for the program staff to publish assignments related to the various courses and classes. It also provides an interface for the students to submit their work, and to recieve evaluation and feedback.

The application is coupled with a dedicated server. The code of that server is developed by another developer and lays in a separate repsitory.
